# Project Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the YK Bike Finder project during the code review and enhancement process.

## Summary

A comprehensive review identified and addressed critical issues related to missing pages, security vulnerabilities, incomplete features, and code quality. All high-priority issues have been resolved.

---

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Navigation Pages ✅

**Issue**: The navbar referenced two pages that didn't exist, causing 404 errors.

**Fixed**:
- Created `/matches` page (`src/app/matches/page.tsx`)
  - Displays AI-powered matches between stolen and found bikes
  - Shows similarity scores and match status
  - Provides side-by-side comparison of matched bikes
  - Includes chat functionality placeholder

- Created `/bikes/my-bikes` page (`src/app/bikes/my-bikes/page.tsx`)
  - Displays user's reported stolen bikes
  - Displays user's reported found bikes
  - Tabbed interface for easy navigation
  - Actions to mark bikes as resolved or remove them

**Impact**: Users can now access all navigation links without encountering errors.

---

### 2. Security Vulnerabilities Fixed ✅

#### Admin Authentication Security

**Issue**: Admin access was determined by email pattern matching (`email.includes('admin')`), which is insecure and easily exploitable.

**Fixed**:
- Added `role` field to User interface (`src/types/index.ts`)
  - Supports 'user', 'admin', and 'moderator' roles
- Updated user creation to set default role (`src/lib/auth.ts`)
- Created `isUserAdmin()` utility function (`src/lib/db.ts`)
- Updated admin page to use role-based authentication (`src/app/admin/page.tsx`)
- Updated Firestore rules to check user role instead of email pattern

**Impact**: Proper role-based access control prevents unauthorized access to admin features.

#### Storage Security

**Issue**: Firebase Storage rules checked for `resource.metadata.userId`, but upload function didn't set this metadata, causing permission issues.

**Fixed**:
- Updated `uploadImage()` to accept optional metadata (`src/lib/storage.ts`)
- Updated `uploadBikeImages()` to include userId, bikeId, and type in metadata
- Fixed storage rules to use `request.resource.metadata.userId` for write operations
- Updated both report pages to pass userId when uploading images

**Impact**: Images are now properly secured and associated with uploading users.

---

### 3. Incomplete Features Completed ✅

#### Image Matching Flow

**Issue**: AI feature extraction was called but extracted features were never stored in the database, making matching incomplete.

**Fixed**:
- Updated stolen bike report page to store averaged image features
- Updated found bike report page to store averaged image features
- Implemented feature averaging across multiple photos using average pooling
- Features now properly stored in `imageFeatures` field for matching

**Impact**: AI-powered bike matching now works end-to-end with stored features.

---

## Code Quality Improvements

### 4. Error Boundary Component ✅

**Added**: `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`

**Features**:
- Catches React errors and prevents app crashes
- Shows user-friendly error message
- Displays technical details in development mode
- Provides "Try Again" and "Go Home" actions
- Follows NWT color palette and design system

**Impact**: Better user experience when errors occur, with graceful degradation.

---

### 5. Input Validation & Sanitization ✅

**Added**: `src/lib/validation.ts`

**Features**:
- `sanitizeString()` - Prevents XSS attacks by removing HTML and script tags
- `sanitizeEmail()` - Normalizes email input
- `sanitizePhone()` - Removes invalid phone characters
- Email, phone, URL, and date validation functions
- `validateStolenBikeForm()` - Comprehensive validation for stolen bike reports
- `validateFoundBikeForm()` - Comprehensive validation for found bike reports

**Validation Rules**:
- Required fields checking
- String length limits (brand: 50 chars, features: 500 chars, etc.)
- Date validation (must be valid and not in future)
- Photo count limits (1-10 photos)
- Location and city requirements

**Impact**: Protection against malicious input and better data quality.

---

### 6. Environment Configuration ✅

**Added**: `.env.local.example`

**Includes**:
- All required Firebase configuration variables
- Clear instructions for setup
- Database URL for Realtime Database (chat)
- Production deployment notes

**Impact**: Easier project setup for new developers.
